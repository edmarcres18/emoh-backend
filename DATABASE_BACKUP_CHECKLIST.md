## 🚀 Setup & Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Ensure Queue Configuration
```bash
# Check .env has:
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

# Run queue migrations if needed
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

### 3. Create Storage Directory
```bash
mkdir -p storage/app/backups
chmod 775 storage/app/backups
```

### 4. Start Queue Worker (Development)
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

### 5. Setup Cron (Production)
```bash
# Add to crontab
* * * * * cd /path/to/emoh-backend && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### 6. Compile Frontend Assets
```bash
npm run build
# or for development
npm run dev
```

### 7. Test the System
```bash
# Create a test backup
php artisan backup:database

# Verify file created
ls -lh storage/app/backups/
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Backup fails with "mysqldump not found"
**Solution**: Install MySQL client tools
```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```

**Issue**: Queue jobs not processing
**Solution**: Restart queue worker
```bash
php artisan queue:restart
```

**Issue**: Permission denied on storage
**Solution**: Fix permissions
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage/
sudo chmod -R 775 storage/
```

**Issue**: Route not found errors
**Solution**: Clear route cache
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan route:cache
```

### Log Files
- Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Queue worker logs: `storage/logs/worker.log`
- Web server logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log` or `/var/log/apache2/error.log`

### Helpful Commands
```bash
# Check backup status
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\DatabaseBackup::latest()->get(['id', 'filename', 'status'])

# Test scheduler
php artisan schedule:run

# View failed jobs
php artisan queue:failed

# Retry failed jobs
php artisan queue:retry all

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear
```
